It's been one month since my last project, the CLI Project. I think Sinatra was a big step towards my learning. It's the first time creating something *real*, something people can actually use, and would use. The first time the world of code suddenly 'clicked' in my head. Obviously, Sinatra is miniscule compared to Rails, but still, I created an actual application. I created an application called GOAL, where users can create goals and share them with other users. I wanted to keep the idea simple, with my main purpose to learn how to actually build the application, but also relevant enough where it might seem cool and useful in the future. Let's walk through how I built this application.

### Step 1: Organize your file structure ###

It's very important you start by organizing correctly and updating your Gemfile to reflect the gems you'll need. Once you have that all set up. It's time to start building your application!
